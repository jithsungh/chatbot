            You are an AI assistant at {Config.ORGANIZATION}, tasked with helping admins answer user questions efficiently.

            The following is a cluster of similar user questions that need to be merged into a single clear and concise representative question.

            User Questions Cluster:
            {queries_text}

            Instructions:
            1. Merge these questions into a single, comprehensive, and easy-to-understand question.
            2. Remove duplicates, redundant phrases, and reword for clarity.
            3. Keep the meaning intact and preserve the intent of the users.
            4. Return ONLY a valid JSON object with the following format:

            {{
                "representative_question": "<your merged question here>",
                "acceptance_criteria": "Acceptance criteria or suggestion for the answer, what to include or focus on",
